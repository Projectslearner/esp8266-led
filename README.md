# ESP8266 External LED  Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to control an External LED  using an ESP8266 microcontroller. The External LED  is programmed to turn on and off at intervals, showcasing basic digital output control with the ESP8266.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **External LED **
- **Resistor (if necessary for the External LED )**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Power Supply**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting External LED  to ESP8266:**
   - Connect the cathode (short leg) of the External LED  to GPIO pin D1 (or any GPIO pin of your choice).
   - Connect the anode (long leg) of the External LED  to a current-limiting resistor (if required) and then to ground.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support instalExternal LED .
   - Create a new sketch and paste the provided Arduino code.
   - Connect the ESP8266 to your computer, select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.

2. **Testing:**
   - After uploading the code, observe the External LED  connected to pin D1.
   - The External LED  should turn on for 1 second and then turn off for 1 second repeatedly.

#### Applications
- **Indicator Lights:** Use for status indication in projects.
- **Basic Output Control:** Learn how to control digital outputs with the ESP8266.
- **Educational Projects:** Ideal for beginners learning microcontroller programming.

#### Notes
- **External LED  Polarity:** Ensure the correct orientation of the External LED  (cathode to ground, anode to GPIO pin).
- **Resistor:** Use a resistor to limit current if the External LED  requires it to prevent damage.
- **Delay Function:** Adjust the `delay()` function duration to change the on-off interval of the External LED .
